# Better-Syndicates-Aesthetics

This is a mod for Victoria 3. A fairly simple mod I made following the guides.

In my opinion, the fact that the USA doesn't change map color when it passes Council Republic is down right criminal, so this mod changes communist USA's color via the dynamic_country_map_colors files appropriately. The new color uses the folowing color code: https://g.co/kgs/F8XexW

In this test branch, I'm attempting to implement more complex flag outcomes, for the progression of the USA from it's colonialits roots, into a more Anarchist or more Marxist-Leninist path. When the USA first passes Council Republic, my goal is to implement a "New Revolutionary USA" flag, roughly evocative of the idea that this is the second "revolution" in the history of the United States. The first being the ![alt text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution ""American Revolution,"") followed by this new, socialist revolution. If your USA went through a Civil War first, your population may consider this the third revolution, after freeing the slaves. However, I usually try to end slavery by the ballot box alone before passing Council Republic, given the research involved. 

Therefore, the way you get each flag is "USA_REV" is when Council Republic is passed. "USA_SYN," the previous defualt if this mod, is for when you have passed Anarchy and Council Republic. Last but not least, "USA_COM" passes through the old communist USA flag from the base game, when USA has both Council Republic and Command Economy. 

What if I have Anarchy, Council Republic, and Command Economy?

Well, anticipating this issue, I made one last flag, "USA_SOC," representing a new American sythesis of Marxist-Leninist and Anarchist thought.

Next Horizon Goal:

[] Create custom New Africa and Cherokee flags to represent Leftist partner states if a Council Republic USA releases them. 
[] Integrate a PELOesque law overhaul for more flavorful flag changes. Especially creating a more explicitly multicultural lefitst USA, which better incorporates BIPOC imagrery

In a later version, I may try to specifically limit the custom flag this mod adds to only when the USA has also passed "Anarchy," regardless, I think my flag better refelects a Syndicalist USA than the base Communist USA flag. This mod therefore changes the 01_flag_definitions_usa.txt so that when the game would normally give USA the old Communist flag, it now gets my new flag, seen here.
