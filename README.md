# Better-Syndicates-Aesthetics

This is a mod for Victoria 3.

A simple mod I made following the guides.

In my opinion, the fact that the USA doesn't change map color when it passes council republic is down right criminal, so this mod changes communist USA's color via the dynamic_country_map_colors files appropriately. The new color uses the folowing color code: https://g.co/kgs/F8XexW

In a later version, I may try to specifically limit the custom flag this mod adds to only when the USA has also passed "Anarchy," regardless, I think my flag better refelects a Syndicalist USA than the base Communist USA flag. This mod therefore changes the 01_flag_definitions_usa.txt so that when the game would normally give USA the old Communist flag, it now gets my new flag, seen here.
